The esp-dsc project was originally built on the old ESP8266 12 chip.  This fork modifies it to work on the NodeMCU DevKits - specifically the AMICA versions but it should work with others.

In making this work, I discovered many idiosyncracies of the chip that are not well documented which caused modifications to the original souces code - specifically around GPIO usage and capacitor requirments.
1. Solder a 0.1uF capacitor directly to the NodeMCU board between VIn (VCC) and GND.  This acts as a high frequency filter to prevent the board from resetting randomly.
2. Bridge your 5v rail (taken directly from the NodeMCU Vin pin) and the GND rail (connected to the NodeMCU GND) with a 470uF capacitor.  This was done to prevent the encoders (which take their power from this rail) from causing a voltage drop on Vin.
3. Use a 10K pull-up resistor from the D3 I/O pin to 5v (not 3.3v!) and from D4 I/O pin to 5v.
4. Connect I/O pin D8 to GND (pull-down).

The original version of this code used pins D4 and D8 for one encoder.  Pins D3, D4 and D8 CANNOT BE USED as with encoders connected, they get pulled in a way that prevents the NodeMCU chip from booting. As such the code here is modified to use D5 and D6 for instead.  I also added code to set the I/O state to INPUT_PULLUP as the default state is to float the input which does not work all the time causing intermitent failure.
